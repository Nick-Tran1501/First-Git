<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I am interested in IT because one of my hobbies is "destroying" my Laptop and finding new application and knowledge about technology. My IT's interest started since I was in grade 10. At that time, my classroom's electronic devices always had errors or something when wrongs so that we need to wait for the school 's IT staff to come. It took lots of time. At that moment, I think I can repair or fix for the class, so I had tried. I succeeded to fix the devices. I started to love IT like that. </li>

  <li>The reasons that I choose RMIT for my career are RMIT's supplied, supporter, staffs, and the way RMIT created the environment for student. I love to become RMIT student because It has all the high-technology supplies that I need for my career. </li>

  <li>To me, I expect to learn both of knowledge and skills. Not only knowledge, Skills are also very important in the future. I want to advance both of this so that I choose RMIT. I hope I can advance it after my studies at RMIT.</</li>

</ul>
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <p>To me, the ideal job that I want to be is Web developer. Website is one of the most important factors that keep and develop every big business. <a>https://topdev.vn/detail-jobs/web-developer-net-c-2-2010623</a>. My Ideal job has a lot of requirements such as HTML5/CSS3, HTML/XHTML/XML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and jQueryUI, ExtJS, Angular JSm and graduate IT career(software). I currently have basic knowledge about HTML, git, and some knowledge about technology. Through my study, I hope I can advance all the requirements for my ideal job.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
  <p>According to 16Personalities, my personality is "The Adventurer". I am a person who was happy to be who I am. I can do whatever I want, go anywhere at any time. I hate to be ban or restricted by rules. Next, let's talk about my learning style which is visual. I usually learned by reading and seeing pictures. It makes me remember the easier than the other ways.</p>

  <p>The results of personality test and learning style test make me understand more about my life's style. In my opinion, the results are correct about 60% of my person. The results will not influence much to my behavior in a team because I am easy-going person and easy to get closer to the others so that I can work effectively in a team. I need the teammates that have the responsibility for the part of work and listen to other teammates. </p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>


  <p>My idea for the project is smart helmet which can project your head, your face, and can use the functions of headphone. The helmet that can listen to music, answer phone call, and look for map is useful in the future. Why should we use the earphone that have robs? Robs are easy broke and make you mad. Some people will say that I should choose airpod for solution but airpod is easy to drop while you are driving. Smart helmet is the better solution for future technology and transportation.</p>
