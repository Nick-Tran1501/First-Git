I need the teammates that have the responsibility for the part of work and listen to other teammates. </p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>


  <p>
    <br>In the technology era, people are getting addicted to electronic devices and high technology equipment. People are using technology while they are taking bath, learning, going out of street, and driving. In Ho Chi Minh, people always use headphone, earphones, or airpods to listen to music while they are driving. First, the headphone is not a good idea for driving because it is too big when your helmet is on your head. Second, earphones have ropes that make users feel mad when solve the tangled. The ropes of earphones sometimes are uncomfortable and exuberance. Finally, airpods are easy to get dropped while driving. What is the solution for all these situations? People will think about why we do not have a gear that can replace the current technology with many disadvantages. Helmet is important to Vietnamese because the rule is wearing helmet while driving. Smart helmet is the best solution for these situations.</br>
<br>What is the helmet? Helmet is the hat that people wear while they are driving to protect their head. Why should we need to have the smart helmet? What are the advantages of the smart helmet? People are using earphone and airpods for listen to music and answer phone call while they are driving. The polices sometimes will make you paid if you are driving with earphone on. The advantages of smart helmet are turn on music without your phone outed, answering phone call, no ropes, and protect your head. People need to have a smart helmet for not to pay unreasonable purpose and enjoy their hobbies.</br>

<br>What will the smart helmet look? The smart helmet will look like the motorbike helmet which will fully cover user’s head. What is special of smart helmet? Smart helmet contains all of functions that drivers need while they are driving. It has Bluetooth Operation panel, speaker, upper and downward ventilation system, and many useful functions. People can imagine that how amazing is the helmet that can connect to your phone by the Bluetooth Operation system. Drivers can listen to music, answer phone call while they are driving. The ventilation system will make users feel comfortable while they are driving. The user will not feel hot or mad with the sunshine or hot wind of the summer. The smart helmet also has lens and goggles to protect user’s face. According to Abhilasha Singh, there were 98 two wheeler  users died per day without helmet in 2017. Following the recording, people can imagine that how many drivers will be died per year without helmet. It will be around 35,770 people died per year. This is in case of without helmet. Rules are important to drivers. In Ho Chi Minh city, there are rules that if drivers do not wear helmet or wear low quality helmet, they will be caught by the polices. The polices will make you pay a lot of money. It will be around 1 million or more if you are caught because of without helmet or low-quality helmet. In this situation, people will think about the smart helmet which follow the rule and will not make you paid because of quality. If the users fall from an accident or event, the smart helmet will automatically call for ambulance and doctors. How can the smart helmet function? Every machine needs electricity or battery to function. Smart helmet is not a special once. Users will need to charge it before going out. In modern time, there are 2 types of charging which are using normal cable and solar energy or Bluetooth charge (Phone situation).</br>
<br>The smart helmet can be controlled by user’s phone or direct by voice. If user uses phone to function the helmet, user will need to install the application same as Apple watch, JBL Bluetooth speaker, or Apple TV.  The application will be free because users already paid when they bought the helmet same as JBL speaker. After downloaded the application, user just need to do one more step which is connect to the helmet.  Users can controller the helmet within 10 meters. The difference between cable charging or solar charging will be around 40 dollars in prices. The helmet’s battery will be full all the time if the users choose to buy a solar energy charging type in value and reality.
	What is the amount of prices for the smart helmet? The price is around 170 dollars for per helmet. In my opinion, it is expensive for the helmet, but it is moderated if users think about its functions.</br>
